<h3 align=center style="color:aqua" >About Me </h3>
My name is Nurullah. I have about 2 years of experience in software testing engineering. I can do manual tests. I
can run API and Database tests in Postman. I can create framework from scratch. I can run
UI tests (Selenium, TestNG, JUnit) on intellije ide with Java code language. I can get all the
necessary reporting via Jenkins and intellije ide. I am completely focused on my work. I am
open to innovations. I want to constantly improve myself. I like my job a little less than my
wife. :)

<h3 align=center style="color:aqua" >About This Project </h3>

• Maven was used as a project configuration tool via Intellij ide as a tool within the scope of the project.
<p></p>
• The 3rd party libraries that will be needed for use in the project are included in the pom.xml file in the project via the maven repository site.
<p></p>
• Selenium Web Driver was used as the technology in the project. On the framework side, Cucumber was preferred. Page Object Model was used during the framework installation phase. However, UI testing techniques were preferred in the project.
<p></p>
• Object Oriented Programming(OOP) has been used in the coding made within the Framework Structure.
<p></p>
• Verifications were made regarding the Assertions and the Flow of the Test at Each Stage.
<p></p>
• Selenium Web Driver version: 4.7.2
<p></p>
• There are 2 different options for the reporting part of the Project. There is the plugin in the Test Runner class in the Runners package and the reporting of the Cucumber library in the pom.xml file.

<h3 align=center style="color:aqua" >Challenges Encountered in the Project </h3>

<p></p>
Difficulties encountered with Locates imported for Web Elements. These difficulties are;
<p></p>
- In some cases, the harnesses could not be made due to the problems caused by the HTML errors in the page infrastructure in the locate operations with CSS and XPath. The solution to this was solved by establishing a parent-child relationship and using the locate method.

Due to the inability to process the site in the expected time due to the infrastructure, the ImplicitlyWait, WaitFor and WaitForVisibility methods from the ReusableMethods Class were used.
